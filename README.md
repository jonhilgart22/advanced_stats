Course Description
----

Advanced Applied Statistics will provide solid training in advanced, practical statistical data analysis and modeling. The course will cover data analysis, Bayesian statistics, time series analysis, stochastic processes, estimation methods.

### By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Carry out advanced data analysis to solve Data Science problems
- Construct Bayesian models to model statistical uncertainty
- Create statistical estimates of parameters
- Perform A/B testing
- Make forecast based on time series data

### Out of Scope

- Visualization and mapping
- Survey data and ANOVA
- Statistical power and sample size
- Regularization
- Advanced Python
- The R programming language

### Prerequisites

- DSCI 6001: Linear Algebra
- DSCI 6002: Data Exploration, Feature Engineering, and Statistics for Data Scientists
- DSCI 6003: Machine Learning I

### Required Resources

Class Structure
----

This course is an "active" learning environment. You'll learn through doing. The focus will be applying concepts through hand calculations and programming.

Before class you will complete preparation materials (e.g., watch videos and read book chapters / blogs). All preparation materials should be covered prior to the start of each class session. They are __always required__ unless explicitly labeled as optional. These materials are the resources for factual knowledge. I (Brian) will not be delivering traditional lectures. You are expected to be familiar with the basic concepts and technical jargon before the start of class.

In-class time is precious - We'll reserve it for discussion, presenting complex material, answering questions, and working on exercises.  

Typical class structure:

1. Discussion
1. Q&A / RAT (Readiness Assessment Test)
1. Lecture
1. Lab

### Discussion

The Discussion is a creative activity to help you to thinking more deeply the preparation materials.

### RATs

The Readiness Assessment Tests (RATs) are intended to test your understanding of the materials presented thus far in the course. This includes recent preparation material and items from previous classes. There are 3 parts: individual, small-group, and class.

1. Each student will answer all the questions on the RAT individually.
2. Then the class will split into teams of 3-4. Each team will answer the same questions again, the goal is to reach consensus. This is an opportunity for peer-to-peer instruction (which is often more effective than lectures!).
3. Finally, the answers to the questions will covered by the class, hopefully resolving any misunderstandings before proceeding.

### Labs

The RATs are meant to assess the first three levels of [Bloom's Taxonomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy#Cognitive): knowledge, comprehension, and analysis. The lab work is meant to develop the latter three levels: analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Students will separate into two (or threes) for "pair programming". These exercises may involve a series of short questions, single day projects, or multi-day projects.

Grades
----

| Item | Weight  |  
|:-------:|:------:|
| Mastery Tracker | 10% |  
| Participation | 20% | 
| Labs | 30 % |
| Final Project | 40% |

The expected grade is B+. Getting an A- or above requires completion of the Mastery Tracker, high level of participation, and a stellar final project.

### Mastery Tracking

Mastery Tracking is a tool to provide feedback student learning. Standards are the core-competencies of MSDS graduates - the knowledge, skills, and habits every student should possess by time they graduate. Standards are measurable, student-focused outcomes that state what students are expected to be able to do by the end of the course. Students who are below ‘mastery’ on a standard are expected to continue practicing said standard (with the instructor's guidance) until they reach mastery. What matters is that students eventually learn the material, not how many attempts it takes to get there. The Instructor and Data Scientist in Residence are available to offer feedback and help guide everyone on their mastery journey.

Mastery Tracking uses a 4-point scale. Every student is expected to achieve 3 or above (Mastery) across all Standards by the end of the course. 1s and 2s indicate areas where students need further practice and/or interventions to reach mastery.

4 pt Scale:

0 = Has not been covered  
1 = Falling far below mastery - Meeting none of the success criteria or has egregious errors  
2 = Approaching mastery - Meeting some of the success criteria  
3 = Mastery - Meeting all of the success criteria  
4 = Exceeding mastery - Truly exceeding expectations and demonstrating proficiency at a higher level of rigor  

We will be using Galvanize's Learning Management System (LMS) which can be found at [learn.galvanize.com](https://learn.galvanize.com).

### Participation

Each person is important to the dynamic of the class, and therefore students are required to participate in class activities. Expect to be "cold called". I call on students at random not to put you on the spot but to keep you engaged in the material at all times.

Attendance is mandatory. It is the responsibility of the student to attend all classes. If you have to miss class, due to sickness or other circumstances, please notify Brian via Slack in advance. Supporting documents (doctor’s notes) should accompany absences due to sickness. Each excused absences beyond 2 or any unexcused absences will result in lowering your __overall course grade by ⅓ of an entire letter grade__ (A->A-, A->B+). It is at the instructor’s discretion to deny any absences or to allow students to make-up assignments, exams, etc. resulted from any absences.

### Final Project

Details will be covered in a future class.

### Electronic Devices

Cell phones can be highly disruptive to the class environment. Please silence these devices. In the event of an emergency, please step out of the classroom.  

You can record my class audio and/or video. It is for your private use only.

### Academic Integrity

GalvanizeU is an academic community based on the principles of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. Academic integrity is a core University value which ensures respect for the academic reputation of the University, its students, faculty and staff, and the degrees it confers.

The University expects that all students will learn in an environment where they work independently in the pursuit of knowledge, conduct themselves in an honest and ethical manner and respect the intellectual work of others. Each member of the University community has a responsibility to be familiar with the definitions contained in, and adhere to, the Academic Integrity Policy. Violations of the Academic Integrity Policy include, but are not limited to:

- Cheating -- i.e. Don't read off of your neighbors exams
- Collusion -- Group work is encouraged except on evaluative exams. When working together (on exercises, etc.), acknowledgment of collaboration is required.
- Plagiarism -- Reusing code presented in labs and lectures is expected, but copying someone else's solution to a problem is a form of plagiarism (even if you change the formatting or variable names).
- Facilitating academic dishonesty

Students who are dishonest in any class assignment or exam will receive an "F" in this course. More information regarding UNH’s official academic integrity policies are outlined in [here](http://www.newhaven.edu/334887.pdf). If you are ever in doubt, ask the instructor for clarification.
